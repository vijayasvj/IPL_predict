## Usage of Daisi

It is recommended to use this application on the daisi platform itself using the link https://app.daisi.io/daisies/vijay/IPL%20Predict/app. However, you can still use your own editor using the below method:

### First, load the Packages:

```
import pydaisi as pyd
ipl_predict = pyd.Daisi("vijay/IPL Predict")
```

### Now, connect to Daisi and access the functions using:

```
ipl_predict.ipl_top_players(playing).value
```

## And done! We have the player rankings to choose our Dream11 Team;)
